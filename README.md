## My process

Hello this is my 14th challenge here in FEM and this challenge gave me some headache because I can't position perfectly the hero image and cant add the box-shadow to it hahaha. Anywayy have a look and give it a try as well in FEM ^^

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- Grid
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

What I learned in this challenge is that I could make element functions properly without having to use any javascript

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
